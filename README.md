## 🌐 Optional: View Your Project Online

You can easily view your project as a standalone webpage!

1. Go to your repository **Settings** (top menu) or `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/settings/pages`
2. On the left, select **Pages**.
3. Under the settings for **Build and deployment**, set the **Branch** from None to `master` `/root` and click **Save**.

4. **Your project will automatically deploy:**
   - GitHub Pages will automatically deploy your project when you push code
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

5. **Access your live project:**
   - Your project will be available at: `https://computational-art-leeds.github.io/[repository-name]`
   - Share this URL with friends or include it in your portfolio!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your repository must be set to **Public** for GitHub Pages to work with the free GitHub plan. This is the default setting, but you can always change this later if you want: Go to `Settings` > `Danger Zone` > `Change repository visibility`...
